TODO:
* correct 'neptun' vs 'Neptun'

NOTES:
* to differentiate between input variables with the same name for different problems the following naming convention is used
for input$ parameters:

    'p1.F' where 'p1' is refering to problem number and 'F' to variable, '.' is the separator

This is used for submit_data.RData as well. Should be harmonized with input_data!!
-->

***

_Deadline: 20/11/2015, Fri 12:00_
